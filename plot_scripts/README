plot1: it does a comparison with numerical and exaustive enumeration of P_D 
       for the transverse magnetization, it does a plot of the two 
       distribution with the relative error (or sigma) as insect

plot2: the same of plot1 but for P_mc

plot3: calculation of the absolute value of the correlation function in the x direction
       for ALL the states. Here I'm using the algorithm with pfaffian (abs!!!)

plot4: still to do, bu the same of plot3 putting the -k,k symmetry
