plot1: it does a comparison with numerical and exaustive enumeration of P_D 
       for the transverse magnetization, it does a plot of the two 
       distribution with the relative error (or sigma) as insect

plot2: the same of plot1 but for P_mc

plot3: calculation of the absolute value of the correlation function in the x direction
       for ALL the states. Here I'm using the algorithm with pfaffian (abs!!!)

plot4: calculation of the correlation function in the x direction 
       for the eigenstate with symmetric occupation k,-k

plot5: comparison with the method of plot3 and plot4, to check the correctness of the calculations

plot6: comparison between time average and canonical average of the transverse magnetization. It does a simple plot of the two quantities as a function of E

plot7: plot of xx-corr as a function of d (non locality ) for various quenches

plot8: calculation of the correlation length and plot of it (of fits and \xi as a function of h_0 and temperature)

plot9: same of the previous point but at each step it ask the 
       interval where to fit (useful for h,h0>1)

plot10: how xx-correlation change with d when there isn't a quench (just a verification of known results - Pfeuty article)

plot12: comparison of the curves with results from semiclassical 
	calculations (see Sachdev) for h<1 (plot of xi in function of temp) --- canonical calculations

plot13: plot of time evolution and long time value of xxcorrelation at 
	distance d. To check the effect of the distance from the quench
	and if the "reduced calculation" (obtained with limit t->infty) is
	valid

plot14: same as plot 13 but now the plot is xxcorrelation as a 
	function of d at a given time in comparison with long time value

plot15: plot of AiAj to try to understand the break down for t larger than
	a given t. (approx 125 for L=512)

plot16: same of plot 9, divided in different parts: canonical, gge, 
	infinite time and at a given time

plot17: comparison between gge data and quench data

plot18: plot of density of states in the plane xx - energy for all 
	the eigenstates with simmetry k,-k

plot19: plot of microcanonical sigma as a 
	function of L, using exaustive enumeration
	-> fixed d, changing L the domain doesn't change
	-> fixed d, changing L the sigma seems to go to zero 

plot20: plot of domain as a function of d, using exaustive enumeration
	not good because we need large l to get values for large d

plot21: analysis of \rho^xx_l for a SINGLE eigenstate, there is some rule?

plot22: wl for the \rho^xx_l jdos

plot23: wl for \rho^xx at given energy, comparison with exact calculation

plot24: wl for \rho^xx at given energy, plot of sigma as a function of L

plot25: wl for \rho^xx in order to compute the domain. plot as a function of l
