plot1: it does a comparison with numerical and exaustive enumeration of P_D 
       for the transverse magnetization, it does a plot of the two 
       distribution with the relative error (or sigma) as insect

plot2: the same of plot1 but for P_mc

plot3: calculation of the absolute value of the correlation function in the x direction
       for ALL the states. Here I'm using the algorithm with pfaffian (abs!!!)

plot4: calculation of the correlation function in the x direction for the eigenstate with symmetric
       occupation k,-k

plot5: comparison with the method of plot3 and plot4, to check the correctness of the calculations

plot6: comparison between time average and canonical average of the transverse magnetization. It does a simple plot of the two quantities as a function of E

plot7: plot of xx-corr as a function of d (non locality ) for various quenches

plot8: calculation of the correlation length and plot of it
